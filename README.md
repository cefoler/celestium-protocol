# Celestium

Celestium is a protocol server where our focus is to create a **stable and performatic** server and **API** for minecraft developers.
The code comparated with the **Mojang NMS** is more clean, structured and easier to learn.

We are currently supporting **Java 17 and async**, and for the project pattern, we are using GRPC-Netty as the protocol server, Flogger for logging and Jackson
for anything related in JSON.
