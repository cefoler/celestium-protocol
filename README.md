# celestium

Celestium is a project where our focus is to recreate a **new NMS and API** for minecraft developers.
The code comparated with the **Mojang NMS** is more clean, structured and performatic.

For the project pattern, we are using Netty as the protocol server, Flogger for logging and Jackson
for anything related in JSON.
